Once upon a time in Downtown Detroit, there lived two great friends named David and Bryan.
At dawn on the third day, a strange creature appeared on the horizon.
Its body, green as grass with a purple tongue roars "I AM PICCOLO!"
As Piccolo saw David and Bryan only one thought was on his mind.
In a flash, there was another presence in the area.
"GOKU!?!?!" yelled Piccolo, "help me fight David and Bryan for their 4 star Dragon ball"
Then Goku began to power up a huge amount of energy and Transformed in to Super Saiyan level 4!!!
<<<<<<< HEAD
"SUPER SAIYAN LEVEL 4??" yelled Bryan. "THAT'S OVER 9000!!" David and Bryan begin to tremble.
David and Bryan, not a pair to be outdone, performed the fusion dance, combining their power and became Bravid.
